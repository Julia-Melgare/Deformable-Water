# Interactive Fluid Animation Using Deformable Meshes and Shaders

This application was developed for the Computer Animation discipline for Msc course in Computer Science at PUCRS. It combines a deformable mesh that is able to interact with rigid bodies alongside a water shader with vertex displacement.
